# Xamarin Ble Explorer Client
This is a simple BLE Explorer for Xamarin, similar to the nRF app. It allows the user to select a BLE device, then shows all available services. Upon selection of a service it will show the available Characteristics. One can then read/write strings or register to Characteristics with "notify" enabled.

Code is based on Jenx Bluetooth example:

All logic is placed in Code Behind in this example.
